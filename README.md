## 🔥 About

Safire is a small, lightweight utils library for C that implements useful data structures such as lists (basically std::vector), hash maps, better string functionality and more. The Goal is to keep the library as lightweight, have no dependencies, and be as fast as possible while also making your life easier when programming.
